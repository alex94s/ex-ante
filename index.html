    <p>This is a collection of projects I am currently working on. I aim to keep subject matters as open as possible
    since I am primarily using this as a central repository to investigate certain themes and ideas of interest. Nonethless, 
    one common thread is the study of probability and inference which at least for the time-being are areas I am keen to explore.
