    <h1>Welcome to My Jupyter Notebook Website</h1>
    
    <p>This is a collection of projects I am currently working on. I aim to keep subject matters as open as possible
    since I am primarily using this as a central repository to explore certain themes and ideas of interest as and when they
    should appear. Nonethless, one common thread is the exploration of probability and inference which at least for the time-being
    are areas I am keen to explore.
